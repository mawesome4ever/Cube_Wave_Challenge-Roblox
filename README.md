# Set Up

If you want to set-up manually, that is, copy-paste the code from the folders rather than downloading the `.RBX` file(which already contains all the files in the appropriate  folder)
then you will need to place each item in their respective hierarchy as shown in the image below:

# Faster set-up

If you just want to click edit and let Roblox open Studio for you, you can go to https://www.roblox.com/games/6011930452/Cube-Wave-Challenge and click on Edit as shown below:

That'll open up Roblox Studio with the place allowing you to save it to your own creations
